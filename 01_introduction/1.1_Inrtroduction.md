# 1.1 Introduction
C is a general-purpose, block-structured, procedural, case-sensitive, free-flow, portable and
high-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. 
<br> 
The selection of ‘C’ as the name of a programming language seems to be an odd choice
but it was named C because it evolved from earlier languages Basic Combined Programming
Language (BCPL) and B. 
<br>
In 1967, Martin Richards developed BCPL for writing system software (i.e. operating systems and compilers). Ken Thompson in 1970 developed a stripped version of BCPL and named
it B. The language B was used to create early versions of UNIX operating system. Both the
languages BCPL and B were ‘typeless’, and every data object occupied one word in the memory. In 1972, Dennis Ritchie developed C programming language by retaining the important
features of BCPL and B programming languages and adding data types and other powerful
features to the retained feature set of BCPL and B. The language C was initially designed as a
system implementation language for developing system software for the UNIX operating system. Thus, it was widely known as the development language of the UNIX operating system.
However, after its popularity, it has spread over many other platforms and is used for creating
many other applications in addition to the system software. Thus, nowadays, C is known as a
general-purpose language and not only as a system implementation language.
